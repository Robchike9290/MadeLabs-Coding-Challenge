# AngularChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.4 and based around SCSS and TypeScript. It renders a list of four aircraft tasks after calculating their maintenance due dates by ascending due date, placing tasks without a due date at the end.  Users can update the daily and current usage hours for one of two aircraft to recalculate the due dates of these tasks for the selected aircraft.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
